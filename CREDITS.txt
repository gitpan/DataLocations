Many thanks go to Mr. Gero Scholz <Gero.Scholz@dresdner-bank.com> (now Global
Head of IT at the Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, Germany) for his personal support
and for writing the "ProMAC" macro processor (some sort of a precursor to Perl,
in spirit) and for implementing the concept of "locations" in it, which inspired
me to write this Perl module!

Mr. Scholz owes his own inspiration to the "DELTA" macro processor (a tool
widely used during the seventies, as it seems), where a rudimentary version
of the concept of "locations" was implemented and where its name ("locations")
seems to originate from.

Many thanks also to my employer, software design & management, and especially
to Andreas Hess <andi@sdm.de>, for their active support (i.e., for granting me
a considerable time budget for my work on the first version of this module).

Many thanks to Wolfgang Herbst <herbst@sdm.de>, Michael Hauser <mike@sdm.de>
and Christian Reiber <christian.reiber@zeppelin.de> for choosing this module
for use in a large software project and for being my first guinea pigs... ;-)

I owe many thanks to Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com> for thoroughly testing this
module, for discovering and reporting the bug fixed in version 4.3, and for
pointing out a design weakness in the implementation of this module, which
has been fixed in version 5.0.

Also many thanks to Graham Barr <gbarr@ti.com> for responding to my bug
report concerning the bug mentioned above, which I filed because it was
not immediately clear from the beginning wether this was actually a bug
in my module or in Perl 5.005 (I thought it was in Perl, because the
module had worked flawlessly with all previous versions of Perl).

Ironically, it turned out to be a bug in my module as well as a bug in
previous versions of Perl, which had canceled out each other in the past.

Moreover, I am especially grateful to Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@umich.edu>
for bearing with me and for investigating this bug together with me.

Special thanks go to the MacPerl CPAN Testers team Paul J. Schinder
<schinder@pobox.com>, Arved Sandstrom <Arved_37@chebucto.ns.ca> and
Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com> for their invaluable help in getting
the test case suite right for the MacOS platform (which has some
peculiarities concerning error messages).
